 * printable characters to create a unique name. While some platforms are more
 * flexible, the HSL always requires this for consistency. Any additional
 * trailing `X`s may result in literal X's (e.g. glibc), or in additional
 * randomness (e.g. BSD) - use a separator (e.g. `fooXXX.XXXXXX`) to guarantee
 * any characters are preserved.
