/** An interface for an IO stream.
 *
 * For example, an IO handle might be attached to a file, a network socket, or
 * just an in-memory buffer.
 *
 * HSL IO handles can be thought of having a combination of behaviors - some of
 * which are mutually exclusive - which are reflected in more-specific
 * interfaces; for example:
 * - Disposable, Closeable, or neither
 * - Seekable
 * - Readable
 * - Writable
 *
 * `IO\DisposableHandle`s are automatically closed at the end of the `using`
 * scope, but do not expose an explicit close method; `IO\CloseableHandle`s are
 * never disposable, but to provide an explicit close method. Some special
 * handles are neither closable or disposable, such as the handle returned by
 * `IO\server_error()`.
 *
 * These can be combined to arbitrary interfaces; for example, if you are
 * writing a function that writes some data, you may want to take a
 * `<<__AcceptDisposable>> IO\WriteHandle` - or, if you read, write, and seek,
 * `<<__AcceptDisposable>> IO\SeekableReadWriteHandle`. If you need to store a
 * handle, remove the `<<__AcceptDisposable>>`; only specify `Closeable` if
 * your code requires that the close method is defined.
 *
 * Some types of handle imply these behaviors; for example, all `File\Handle`s
 * are `IO\SeekableHandle`s.
